            <h4 class="sub-title"> Start your day with a smile! </h4>
            <p> Popcorn gives you the same crunchy bite that chips or crackers offer, but with much fewer calories — so long as it’s air-popped and not drenched in butter. 
                Popcorn is great because it’s so versatile and its neutral flavor allows for tons of flavor combinations. 
            </p>
            <p> What to serve on air-popped popcorn? - <br>
                While not as good at dipping as traditional chips and crackers, the flavor toppings and combinations are basically unending.
                You can decide whether to go traditionally salty with this snack or make it sweet with a kettle corn recipe.</p>

                <p> Rather than reaching for that bottomless bowl of chips, try a handful of mixed nuts instead. 
                    Fried potato chips contribute lots of unhealthy fats to your diet, like trans and saturated fats. 
                    While mixed nuts are also high in fat, nuts are high in mono- and poly-unsaturated fats.

                    <p> This snack is more nutritious than regular chips — you can tell by the color! 
                        Sweet potatoes are rich in vitamin B6 and also contain a good amount of iron, vitamin C, and vitamin D.

                        <p>We’re not going to argue that kale chips aren’t trying their best to imitate traditional potato chips, 
                            but we stand by them being just as delicious — and they’re way more nutritious!
                            High in iron, calcium, and antioxidants, kale chips are a nutritional win compared to potato chips or crackers.

                            <li>If kale is wet, very thoroughly pat dry with a clean kitchen towel; transfer to a large bowl. Drizzle the kale with oil and sprinkle with salt. Using your hands, massage the oil and salt onto the kale leaves to evenly coat. Fill 2 large rimmed baking sheets with a layer of kale, making sure the leaves don't overlap. (If the kale won't all fit, make the chips in batches.)</li>
                            <li>Bake until most leaves are crisp, switching the pans back to front and top to bottom halfway through, 8 to 12 minutes total. (If baking a batch on just 1 sheet, start checking after 8 minutes to prevent burning.)</li>
